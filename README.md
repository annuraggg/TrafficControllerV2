# TrafficControllerV2

Welcome to **TrafficControllerV2**—an Arduino-based project developed to simulate advanced traffic control systems using ultrasonic sensors and other hardware components. This repository is my experimental playground for prototyping and testing intelligent traffic management algorithms in a hands-on, hardware-driven environment.

## Project Overview

TrafficControllerV2 is designed to mimic real-world traffic scenarios using sensors such as ultrasonic modules attached to an Arduino board. The goal is to demonstrate how sensor-based data acquisition and processing can be leveraged to optimize traffic flow, automate traffic signals, and improve overall road safety.

## Key Features

- **Arduino Integration:** All control logic runs on Arduino microcontrollers, enabling direct interfacing with physical sensors and actuators.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Used for detecting vehicle presence, measuring distances, and gathering real-time traffic data.
- **Modular Hardware Design:** Easily extendable to incorporate additional sensors (IR, cameras, etc.) or connect to external modules.
- **Simulation & Automation:** Provides both real and simulated traffic control mechanisms for experimentation and demonstration.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- Ultrasonic sensors (e.g., HC-SR04)
- Breadboard, jumper wires, and standard electronic components
- Arduino IDE

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/annuraggg/TrafficControllerV2.git
    cd TrafficControllerV2
    ```

2. **Open the Arduino sketch:**
    - Launch Arduino IDE and open the main `.ino` file from this repo.

3. **Wire up the hardware:**
    - Connect ultrasonic sensors and other peripherals as described in the code comments and hardware diagrams (if available).

4. **Upload and Run:**
    - Upload the sketch to your Arduino board and observe the traffic simulation in action.

## Repository Structure

- `src/` — Contains Arduino sketches and logic for traffic control and sensor integration.
